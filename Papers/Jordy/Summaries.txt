Handwritten digit recognition based on corner detection and convolutional neural network.

Not really a usefull paper. The corner recognition is not used for classifying the digits but for finding the digits in a larger sheet of paper. They use a big CNN with pictures of 224 by 224, so that's a no for us :(
